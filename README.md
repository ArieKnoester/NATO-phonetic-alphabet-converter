# NATO-phonetic-alphabet-converter

A small Python course exercise introducing list and dictionary 
comprehensions. The user enters a string. The program displays
the phonetic alphabet spelling of the string.

### Example:
If the user inputs, 'Sally'. The output will be: 

`['Sierra', 'Alfa', 'Lima', 'Lima', 'Yankee']`

#### Note
I've read that iterating through a Pandas DataFrame is discouraged 
for performance reasons. 
1. The requirements for this exercise specified iterating through
the DataFrame
2. I believe the practice is discouraged for very large data sets.
The number of rows in this set is quite small.
